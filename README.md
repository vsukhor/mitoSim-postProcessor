### mitosim-postProcessor

Complements [**mitoSim**](https://github.com/vsukhor/mitoSim) - a simulator of mitochondria as spacelss graph.

This repository contains Python 3 code for:

* Numerical solution and analysis of differential-algebraic system approximating the mitochondria graph [src/odes.py](src/odes.py)

* Analysis of some simulation results reported in the logfile [src/time-dependent.py](src/time-dependent.py).  
While the actual logfile is to be generated by running the **mitoSim** simulation, example 
  files are given in [/data](/data) directory. 

For convenience, the scripts are accompanied by the corresponding ipython notebooks.

It is recommended that the work is done using Python virtual environment:

`$ python3 -m venv venv`  
`$ source ./venv/bin/activate`  
`(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt` 

Then, the script can be launched the ordinary way:

`(venv) $ python src/odes.py`  

To install and use the notebook:
 
`(venv) $ pip install jupyter`  
`(venv) $ jupyter notebook odes.ipynb` 

The scripts were tested with Python 3.9 and jupyter-notebook v. 6.0.3.
